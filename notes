# vim: set filetype=markdown : 

**LESSON**: In shell, both *while* and *for* loops rely on $IFS (input field separator). Manipulating it creates too many SIDE EFFECTS. +1 for functional languages. How many hours did I spend debugging? Don't use shell scripting for stuff like this. 

## TODO 

1. if date undef, obtain from mod time.
1. Use a more ephemeral name: $concat_temp='input_files.txt';

## Comments 

- A `do` block (`do $CONF_FILE`) cannot modify lexicals in containing scope.

## Thoughts

- Rename command for 'auto' setting of output filename
